### INSIGHTS FROM DATA

### SUMMARY OF SALES TRENDS FROM NOV TO DEC 2024

1. GMV: $820,508 → $849,000 (+3.47% MoM)

2. Margin value: $114,982 → $118,172 (≈+2.8% MoM)

3. Top Products (GMV / Qty / Margin Share)
The leaders list is not identical across the three metrics
Some items drive revenue (GMV) but not volume, suggesting higher price points
Others are workhorse SKUs (Qty leaders) that can be featured for traffic/customer retention
Products with high margin share are profit engines even if their GMV are not top 1–2

3. Category: mix shifted slightly. Based on %GMV by category,
Home & Living remains #1 category (~47% → ~45%)
Health & Beauty shifted up a bit (~24%→ ~25%)
Food & Beverage rose 2% (~6% → ~8%)
Consumer Electronics decreased slightly (~23% → ~22%)

4. By channel: performance is very similar across CCTR and ONLE; ONLE edges ahead on net qty (2516 vs 2488)

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Act on the three “Top 5” lists
GMV leaders: run cross-sell bundles and cart-value boosters (e.g., “Complete the set” accessory bundles)
Qty leaders: use for traffic campaigns; high number of purchases likely attracts customer visits
Margin leaders: feature in prominent placements with lighter discounting and loyalty point multipliers instead of price cuts. This is to preserve profits

2. Category strategy
Home & Living: keep always-on exposure
Food & Beverage: Dec uplift suggests seasonality; we can capture this with limited-time deals

3. Channel optimization
Given similar channel performance, run an A/B split of the same campaign across CCTR vs ONLE to measure: Cost to sell, refund rate, net margin per order
Once we have validated this, we can shift budget toward the better net margin channel
